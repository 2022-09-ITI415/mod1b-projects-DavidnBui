# Module1-Projects
 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

My goals in making this project was to build upon a previous project. I decided to make some changes to roll a ball because it was pretty plain so I added a maze to make it a little more interesting. 

My original idea was to remake pong but a lot of what I found was that game was made in 2d and I wanted to implement 3d structures to a 2d world. I started with making the layout and scene and it was going well until I had to write up scripts for the movement of the paddle and ball. 

When I wrote the script for the paddle it would move up and down on the Y axis instead of the Z axis and the physics for it all was all over the place so I scraped the idea.

I ended up going back to roll a ball and seeing what I could do to make it different.
